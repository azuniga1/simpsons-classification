# FINAL PROJECT Machine Learning - Keras Imagine Recognition Model
Members: Daniel Fischer, Mo Habib, Fazliddin Naimov, Kevin Freehill, Dahmane Skendraoui, Peter Kim

Goal:
Image recognition application.
A (pretained) Keras model is used to identify sets of animated images by the name of the character.

Dataset:
Animated images of Simpsons characters will be converted to PIL array values. Over 900 images will be used the trained the Keras model.

Process:
Using flask app, a sample imagine will be display and the correct character name predicted.

Applications:
We will use pandas, python to uscss, html, javascript
Model will sit outside of the route.
